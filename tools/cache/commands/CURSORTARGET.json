The target has to be known to the player to some degree ([[knowsAbout]] &gt; 0). If target is completely unknown, command returns [[objNull]].\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A valid target could belong to an enemy or a friendly side. Buildings are normally known to player and so are valid targets. Try [[nearTargets]] to see what else is considered a target. While friendly targets are usually known to the player, enemy targets can be totally unknown, especially if \"auto-spotting\" (or sometimes called \"auto-reporting\") is switched off. To check if auto-spotting is enabled:&lt;tt&gt;[[difficultyEnabled]] \"autospot\"&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[cursorTarget]] also returns locked target for the duration of the lock even if there is another target under the cursor. As soon as missile is fired, [[cursorTarget]] switches to current known target under cursor or [[objNull]]. Targeting (currently \"T\" in Arma 3) works regardless of the state of \"auto-spotting\".\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding a target to the known list could be done with [[reveal]] command. When auto-spotting is enabled, zooming on the enemy target with cross-hairs usually reveals the target. As friendly targets are always known, zooming on friendly target could improve [[knowsAbout]] value.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Side relations]] can also influence target knowledge. For example [[east]] target is unknown target for [[civilian]], but making them friends with [[setFriend]] instantly improves [[civilian]] knowledge of the [[east]].\n\n</value></part><part><name index=\"4\"/><value> '''cursorTarget'''\n\n</value></part><part><name index=\"5\"/><value> [[Object]]\n\n</value></part><part><name>x1</name>=<value> &lt;code&gt;[[alive]] [[cursorTarget]];&lt;/code&gt;\n\n</value></part><part><name>seealso</name>=<value> [[cursorObject]], [[getCursorObjectParams]], [[laserTarget]], [[nearTargets]], [[knowsAbout]], [[reveal]], [[lineIntersects]], [[lineIntersectsWith]], [[lineIntersectsObjs]], [[lineIntersectsSurfaces]], [[intersect]], [[checkVisibility]]\n</value></part></template>\n\n&lt;dl class='command_description'&gt;\n<comment>&lt;!-- Note Section BEGIN --&gt;\n</comment>\n&lt;dd class=\"notedate\"&gt;Posted on  01:25, 18 February 2011 (CET)&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt class=\"note\"&gt;[[GLT Myke]]&lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"note\"&gt;\nIf the player is in a vehicle and a lockable weapon is selected and a target is locked, the locked target will be returned, regardless if it is in sight or not.\n\n&lt;dd class=\"notedate\"&gt;Posted on 11 March 2011&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt class=\"note\"&gt;[[User:kju|kju]] &lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"note\"&gt;\nAddition to Myke's note:\nIt also works for infantry with launchers that canLock, like Javelin or AA.\nOnly the lock cursor must be visible on the target - not a full lock necessarily.\n\n&lt;dd class=\"notedate\"&gt;Posted on 13:09, 11 July 2009 (CEST)&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt class=\"note\"&gt;[[User:Lou Montana|Lou Montana]]&lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"note\"&gt;\n*Player must [[knowsAbout|knows about]] what he is pointing to for this command to return something other than &lt;NULL-OBJECT&gt;\n*This command doesn't work through building windows\n*This recognition doesn't work with every object : soldiers, vehicles, big houses are ok, but not trees, plants, road signs or others little things\n\n&lt;dd class=\"notedate\"&gt;Posted on 22:11, 23 August 2013 (CEST)&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt class=\"note\"&gt;[[User:Killzone_Kid|Killzone_Kid]]&lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"note\"&gt;\nTo add to Lou Montana's note, use [[reveal]] command on the object you want to be detected with [[cursorTarget]] when pointing at it. Without it, distant units are most likely to return [[objNull]] even if you shoot and hit them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Units that have been previously subjected to [[enableSimulation]] false; or [[enableSimulationGlobal]] false; may stay unrecognised for a long time even after simulation was re-enabled, returning [[objNull]] as [[cursorTarget]]. Force revealing units with [[reveal]] command usually solves the problem. For example: &lt;code&gt;{[[player]] [[reveal]] _x} [[forEach]] [[allUnits]];&lt;/code&gt;\n\n\n<comment>&lt;!-- Note Section END --&gt;\n</comment>&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>GameCategory</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value>arma2</value></part><part><name index=\"2\"/><value>Scripting Commands</value></part></template>\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>GameCategory</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value>arma3</value></part><part><name index=\"2\"/><value>Scripting Commands</value></part></template>\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>GameCategory</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value>tkoh</value></part><part><name index=\"2\"/><value>Scripting Commands</value></part></template>\n[[Category:Scripting Commands|<template><title>uc:<template><title>PAGENAME</title></template></title></template>]]\n\n<comment>&lt;!-- CONTINUE Notes --&gt;\n</comment>&lt;dl class=\"command_description\"&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"notedate\"&gt;Posted on December 3, 2014 - 18:40 (UTC)&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt class=\"note\"&gt;[[User:DreadedEntity|DreadedEntity]]&lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;dd class=\"note\"&gt;\n[[cursorTarget]] seems to change when your cursor enters an object's [[boundingBox]].
